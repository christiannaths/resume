    "Hi, my name is Christian and I'm a full stack engineer. Since 2015 I've specialized in helping early-stage startup founders transform their product ideas into market-ready solutions. I love working across the entire stack, from delightfully designed React and React Native frontends, to automated CI/CD containerized deployments. My approach centers on writing focused, maintainable, typesafe systems that keep projects aligned with both technical and business objectives."
